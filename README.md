# PF2E-Tools-To-FantasyGround

This python script is meant to parse the JSON files that https://pf2etools.com/ produces.
Currently only feats are included in this.  Future pasrsing is planned.
In order to get the JSON file you must select all of the feats that you want and then pin them. 
After your feats have been pinned, you can then right click on the list and press the Download JSON Data.
Places this data into the Website folder and then run the python script.
You can then take the produced mod file and drop it into your mod folder for fantasy ground

Happy gaming! :)
